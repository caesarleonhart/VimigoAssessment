The following are the user stories:
A cloud-based software application grew in user traction and the product owner started to ask
the developers which module and features are most widely used. The product owner needs
insights about which developed features are the most important to the user and which feature
may not be as useful as he thought. To properly measure the featuresâ€™ usage, the product owner
needs insights per company, per users, per module, and per feature over a daily and monthly
period.

proposal

Answer

In order to track the features usage, there is a few third party tools that comes to mind. These are:- 

1. Google Analytics
2. Crazyegg
3. Hotjar

Crazyegg and Hotjar is a heatmapping tools where we can see how the user interact on our site though these two tracks only in general. 
Whereas Google Analytics is a tracking tool where we can track a lot of things based on our configuration.

I would suggest to use Google Analytics to get more in depth measures based on company, user and etc.
